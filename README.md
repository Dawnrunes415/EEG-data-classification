## Overview

This project implements a deep learning model for **seizure prediction from EEG signals**, using the [EEG Seizure Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adibadea/chbmitseizuredataset) based on [CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database](https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/).

The system classifies whether a seizure will occur within the next 30 seconds, aiming to support clinical decision-making and early-warning systems for patients with epilepsy.

Our model combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for temporal modeling, providing robust performance on time-series EEG data.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [EEG Seizure Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adibadea/chbmitseizuredataset)
- **Description:** EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with intractable seizures.
- **Format:** Each sample is a window of EEG data with shape `(channels, timesteps)`.

## Model Architecture

- **CNN Layers:** Extract local spatial patterns from EEG channels
- **LSTM Layers:** Capture long-term temporal dependencies
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Classify preictal vs. non-preictal states

---

## Results

- **Validation Accuracy**: ~94.8%

- **Validation AUROC**: ~0.96

- **Validation F1-score**: ~0.83

- **False Negative Rate (FNR)**: ~0.13
